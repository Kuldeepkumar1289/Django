My Django project is a Disease Prediction and Consultation System designed to help users identify
<br/>
possible diseases based on their symptoms and get consultation options. It features:

• User Roles: Admin, Doctor, and Patient.
• Patient Profile: Stores patient details and medical history.
• Symptom Checker: Uses intelligent data mining to predict potential diseases based on symptoms.
• Consultation & Feedback: Patients can connect with doctors for further consultation.
• Authentication System: Secure login for different user roles.
